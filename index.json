From our extensive measurements, the Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature that is recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps, can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol that we call LMAC for LoRa networks. This paper presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implements CSMA, balances the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes' local information and then additionally the gateway's global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2× goodput improvement and 2.4× reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should the LoRaWAN's ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.","tags":null,"title":"LMAC: Efficient Carrier-Sense Multiple Access for LoRa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dixing Xu","Mengyao Zheng","Linshan Jiang","Chaojie Gu","Rui Tan","Peng Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584748800,"objectID":"ebe46a37a80996aa4cbdc6124b81a6e3","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/aiot_iotj/","publishdate":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aiot_iotj/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lightweight and Unobtrusive Data Obfuscation at IoT Edge for Remote Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaojie Gu","Linshan Jiang","Rui Tan","Mo Li","Jun Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584057600,"objectID":"8d5c18053de247ddbeb98a01456976b5","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/securetimestamping/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/securetimestamping/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Attack-Aware Data Timestamping in Low-Power Synchronization-Free LoRaWAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengyao Zheng","Dixing Xu","Linshan Jiang","Chaojie Gu","Rui Tan","Peng Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560297600,"objectID":"e6526dce22df098a1e02f1faba9858f8","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/aiot/","publishdate":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aiot/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Challenges of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaojie Gu","Rui Tan","Xin Lou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560297600,"objectID":"44e8c2e2b64933a815dddce2e3ab79a4","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/loracp_jour/","publishdate":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loracp_jour/","section":"publication","summary":"Separation of Control and Data Planes (SCDP) is a desirable paradigm for low-power multi-hop wireless sensor networks requiring high network performance and manageability. Existing SCDP networks generally adopt an in-band control plane scheme in that the control-plane messages are delivered by their data-plane networks. The physical coupling of the two planes may lead to undesirable consequences. Recently, multi-radio platforms (e.g., TI CC1350 and OpenMote B) are increasingly available, which make the physical separation of the control and data planes possible. To advance the network architecture design, we propose to leverage on the long-range communication capability of the  Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) radios to form one-hop out-of-band control planes.  LoRaWAN, an open, inexpensive, and ISM band based LPWAN radio, is chosen to prototype our out-of-band control plane called LoRaCP. Several characteristics of LoRaWAN such as downlink-uplink asymmetry and primitive ALOHA media access control need to be dealt with to achieve high reliability and efficiency. To address these challenges, a TDMA-based multi-channel  transmission control is designed, which features an urgent channel and negative acknowledgment. On a testbed of 16 nodes,  LoRaCP is applied to physically separate the control-plane network of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) from its Zigbee-based data-plane network. Extensive experiments show that LoRaCP increases CTP's packet delivery ratio from 65% to 80% in the presence of external interference, while consuming a per-node average radio power of 2.97mW only.","tags":null,"title":"One-hop Out-of-band Control Planes for Multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaojie Gu","Rui Tan","Jun Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550016000,"objectID":"80022f8d7e7cc49e473986c683932930","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/softlora_poster/","publishdate":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/softlora_poster/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-power wide-area network technologies such as LoRa will be important for achieving ubiquitous connectivity required by Internet of Things. Different from the existing studies that focus on LoRa's communication performance, we study two physical properties of LoRa, i.e., its performance in timing the signal propagation and the transmitters' frequency traits. Signal timing is a basis for implementing clock synchronization, ranging, and advanced physical (PHY) layer techniques such as concurrent decoding. However, LoRa end devices do not provide PHY-layer timestamping that is needed for accurate timing. We propose a *SoftLoRa* design that integrates a low-power software-defined radio receiver with a LoRa transceiver to provide PHY-layer access. Experiments show that SoftLoRa achieves microseconds timing accuracy over one kilometer and in a multistory building with strong signal attenuation.Signal propagation timing is in general susceptible to a *frame delay attack*. We implement this attack against LoRa by a combination of stealthy jamming and delayed replay. To address the attack, we investigate the inherent frequency biases of LoRa transmitters. With an efficient signal processing algorithm, our frequency bias estimation achieves a resolution of 0.14 parts-per-million (ppm) of the channel's central frequency. This resolution is sufficient to detect the attack that introduces an additional frequency bias of one or more ppm. In sum, this work provides an accurate and secure LoRa-based timing approach.","tags":null,"title":"(Poster) SoftLoRa -- A LoRa-Based Platform for Accurate and Secure Timing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaojie Gu","Linshan Jiang","Rui Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546387200,"objectID":"bd8e0b7ba0d96c83944d629f4f25f54e","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/loralocalization/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loralocalization/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies featuring long-range communication capability and low power consumption will be important for forming the Internet of Things (IoT) consisting of many geographically distributed objects.

This paper presents a room-level indoor localization approach based on the measured room's echos in response to a two-millisecond single-tone inaudible chirp emitted by a smartphone's loudspeaker. Different from other acoustics-based room recognition systems that record full-spectrum audio for up to ten seconds, our approach records audio in a narrow inaudible band for 0.1 seconds only to preserve the user's privacy. However, the short-time and narrowband audio signal carries limited information about the room's characteristics, presenting challenges to accurate room recognition. This paper applies deep learning to effectively capture the subtle fingerprints in the rooms' acoustic responses. Our extensive experiments show that a two-layer convolutional neural network fed with the spectrogram of the inaudible echos achieve the best performance, compared with alternative designs using other raw data formats and deep models. Based on this result, we design a RoomRecognize cloud service and its mobile client library that enable the mobile application developers to readily implement the room recognition functionality without resorting to any existing infrastructures and add-on hardware. Extensive evaluation shows that RoomRecognize achieves 99.7%, 97.7%, 99%, and 89% accuracy in differentiating 22 and 50 residential/office rooms, 19 spots in a quiet museum, and 15 spots in a crowded museum, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches based on support vector machine, RoomRecognize significantly improves the Pareto frontier of recognition accuracy versus robustness against interfering sounds (e.g., ambient music).","tags":null,"title":"Deep Room Recognition Using Inaudible Echos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaojie Gu","Rui Tan","Xin Lou","Dusit Niyato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"790cedb9aa97ef4dc22259ce38fa38f1","permalink":"https://chaojiegu.github.io/publication/loracp/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loracp/","section":"publication","summary":"Separation of control and data planes (SCDP) is a desirable paradigm for low-power multi-hop wireless networks requiring high network performance and manageability.
